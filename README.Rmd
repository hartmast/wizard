# wizard

A set of convenience functions for everyday programming. Work in progress. Currently just a bunch of functions that I use very often.

## qbarplot

The `qbarplot()` function allows for quickly generating ggplot2 barplots from raw dataframes:

```{r example, eval = FALSE}

qbarplot(diamonds, color, cut)

```


## load_packages

The `load_packages()` functions checks wher the packages specified as its arguments are installed and installs them if they are not. If `require = TRUE` (the default), they are also loaded in the process.


## To be continued

More functions following soon!
